1. Advantages of using React

    React requires less code compared to other development platforms.
    Reusable components: This makes the application more scalable and easier to maintain as errors will occur in the component's own functionality or in its communication with the rest.
    Improves the user experience when navigating the web application, the speed at which pages load and facilitates the maintenance of the application.
